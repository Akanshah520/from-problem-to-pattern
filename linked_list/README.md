# Linked List (Basic)

The Linked List pattern focuses on pointer manipulation and edge-case handling
in linear data structures.

Unlike arrays, linked lists require careful control of references,
as elements are not stored contiguously in memory.

This pattern is tested to evaluate correctness, clarity,
and comfort with mutable data structures.

## Core Idea

Every operation on a linked list involves:
- Updating pointers correctly
- Preserving access to the remaining list
- Handling null (`None`) boundaries safely

Small pointer mistakes often lead to broken lists,
so clarity is more important than cleverness.
